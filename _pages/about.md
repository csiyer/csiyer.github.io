Hello! I'm a PhD student in Columbia University's Psychology Department and [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu). Advised by [Daphna Shohamy](https://shohamylab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu), I study the brain's multiple learning systems, how they are shaped by our environments, and how they cooperate to guide adaptive behavior. I am interested in formalizing models of hippocampal-entorhinal circuit, basal ganglia, and other systems to translate our constructs of learning and memory between tasks, measurements, and species.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Stanford University. Advised by [Anthony Wagner](https://memorylab.stanford.edu) and [tyler bonnen](https://tzler.github.io), I studied how race-biased memory behaviors emerge from distinct interactions between biases in the visual and episodic memory systems. I then worked in the [Poldrack Lab](https://poldracklab.org) with [Patrick Bissett](https://bissettp.github.io), collecting large-scale fMRI datasets on cognitive control tasks and studying how between-individual structure in functional control networks can be recovered with functional alignment and shared response models.

Previously, I have worked as an investigator, legal assistant, and data scientist at several public interest and community law centers ([Habeas Corpus Resource Center](https://www.hcrc.ca.gov), [Asian Law Caucus](https://www.asianlawcaucus.org), [UnCommon Law](https://www.uncommonlaw.org)). I believe in using insights from neuroscience and psychology to guide and inspire more restorative approaches to harm and suffering, and work directly with my former colleagues to do so.

I am also a trumpet player in the creative improvised and Black American Music traditions--you can find upcoming shows and recent videos on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chris.iyer/)!
