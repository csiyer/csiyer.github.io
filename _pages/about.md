Hello! I'm a PhD student in Columbia University's Psychology Department and [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu). Advised by [Daphna Shohamy](https://shohamylab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu), I study the brain's multiple learning systems, how they are shaped by our environments, and how they cooperate to guide adaptive behavior. Specifically, I am working to build experimental and theoretical bridges across tasks, measurements, and species to understand the domain-general computations performed by the hippocampus, MTL cortex, and basal ganglia during lifelike behavior.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Stanford University. Advised by [Anthony Wagner](https://memorylab.stanford.edu) and [tyler bonnen](https://tzler.github.io), I studied how biases in our perceptual and memory systems distinctly contribute to race-related bias in our memories. I then worked in the [Poldrack Lab](https://poldracklab.org) with [Patrick Bissett](https://bissettp.github.io), collecting large-scale fMRI datasets on cognitive control tasks and studying how inter-individual structure in functional control networks can be recovered with functional alignment and shared response models.

Previously, I have worked as an investigator, legal assistant, and data scientist at several public interest and community law centers ([Habeas Corpus Resource Center](https://www.hcrc.ca.gov), [Asian Law Caucus](https://www.asianlawcaucus.org), [UnCommon Law](https://www.uncommonlaw.org)). I believe that insights from neuroscience and psychology can guide and inspire more restorative approaches to harm and suffering, and I work with my former colleagues to find ways to do so.

I also play the trumpet--you can find upcoming shows and recent videos on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chris.iyer/)!
